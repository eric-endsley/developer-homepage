      <h2>About Me</h2> 
      <p>
        My name is <strong>Eric</strong> and I have just begun my journey to become a software developer at Epicodus. I am a 26-year-old lifelong Oregonian, currently residing in Milwaukie. I am passionate about politics, the environment, and helping others. I hope that one day I will be able to use my coding skills to contribute to projects that can help solve some of the many pressing issues confronting our world. I love to learn new things and I couldn't be more enthusiastic about devoting the upcoming 6 months to becoming the best developer I can be!
